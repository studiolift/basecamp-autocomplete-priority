# Auto complete priority for Basecamp Classic

When typing [h [w [c or [s it will auto complete to [HOT] [WARM] [COLD] or [*]

## Installation

Open the Userscript and you will be prompted to install the extension.
Or drag the js file into the extentions window if this does not work automatically.

## Usage

Just type [h [w [c or [s at the beginning of a todo and it will auto complete.
If there is an existing priority then it will substitute the existing one with the new one you type before it. e.g. [s[WARM] will go to [COLD]
